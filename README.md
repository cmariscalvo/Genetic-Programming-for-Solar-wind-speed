Symbolic Regression of Solar wind speed predictions made by SWAN predictive model, an artificial intelligence project developed by Alcal√° de Henares Universit.

This project aims to represent, with equations, the prediction of solar wind speed (fast and slow solar wind) made by SWAN, depending o several factors such as solar wind density or temperature.

The results are included in the 'Results' folder and are obtained following mono objective and multiobjective genetic programming strategies.
